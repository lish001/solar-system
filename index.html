            Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
            Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – 
            the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. 
            Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.

                Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s a little bigger than Earth’s Moon. 
                It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
                <br>
                <br>
                Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. 
                It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. 
                Mercury likes to keep things simple.

                Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. 
                But a year on Mercury goes fast. 
                Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. 
                Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. 
                Its thick atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The atmosphere traps heat, making it feel like a furnace on the surface.
                Venus is sometimes called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and structure, but the planets are very different in other ways.

                In addition to being extremely hot, Venus is unusual because it spins in the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. 
                It also has a very slow rotation making its day longer than its year.

                It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. 
                Earth is special because it is an ocean planet.

                Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes.

                Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones.
                The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. 
                They’re made of chunks of ice and rock.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
                When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing.
